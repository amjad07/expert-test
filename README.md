# Expert Test – Lead Capture Form Improvements

This project includes a Supabase Edge Function for sending personalized confirmation emails and a React lead capture form. Below are recent fixes and improvements made to the form logic.

---

## 1. Confirmation Email Function Called Twice

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Problem
The confirmation email function (`send-confirmation`) was being called twice during form submission, causing:
- Redundant API calls
- Increased server load and risk of 500 Internal Server Errors
- Possible double emails sent to leads

### Root Cause
A copy-paste error resulted in two identical `supabase.functions.invoke()` calls in the `handleSubmit` method.

### Fix
Removed the duplicate call and retained a single invocation wrapped in a `try/catch` block:

```tsx
const { error: emailError } = await supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', {
  body: {
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    industry: formData.industry,
  },
});
```

### Impact
- ✅ Reduced server load
- ✅ Eliminated 500 errors from duplicate invocations
- ✅ Prevented multiple confirmation emails per submission
- ✅ Cleaner and more maintainable form logic

## 2. Missing Loader on Form Submission

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Problem
When clicking "Get Early Access," there was no indication that the form was being submitted, leading to:
- Multiple rapid clicks
- Duplicate submissions
- User confusion

### Root Cause
The form lacked a loading state during the async confirmation email process.

### Fix
Added a loading state using `useState`, displayed a loader while `supabase.functions.invoke` runs, and disabled form inputs during the async operation.

```tsx
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
{loading ? <p>Sending confirmation...</p> : null}
```

### Impact
- ✅ Improved UX with feedback on submission
- ✅ Prevented repeated form submissions
- ✅ Increased user confidence


## 3. "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')" Error
**File:** `supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

Problem
The Supabase Edge Function was throwing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')" errors when processing AI-generated email content, resulting in:

Complete function failures
No confirmation emails sent
Poor user experience
Console errors
Root Cause
Several issues in the AI content handling:

Incorrect array indexing (choices[1] instead of choices[0])
No null safety for the .replace() method
Lack of fallback content when AI response was missing
Solution
Improved error handling and added null safety:

```tsx
// Corrected array indexing
const content = data?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content;

// Added null safety for .replace()
${(personalizedContent || '').replace(/\n/g, '<br>')}

// Fallback content if AI response is missing
if (!content) {
  console.warn('No content received from OpenAI, using fallback');
  return fallbackContent;
}
```

Impact
- ✅ Eliminated undefined property errors
- ✅ Added robust fallback content
- ✅ Improved function reliability
- ✅ Enhanced error logging


## 4. Graceful Degradation for Email Service Failures

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Problem
If the Supabase email function failed, the form submission would break or provide unclear feedback, resulting in:
- Form submission failures
- Confusing user experience
- No clear indication of success or failure
- Potential loss of lead data

### Root Cause
The form did not handle email service errors gracefully and lacked proper user feedback mechanisms.

### Fix
Added robust error handling and user feedback to ensure the form always completes, even if the email service fails:

```tsx
// Track email success
const [emailSuccess, setEmailSuccess] = useState(false);

// Enhanced error handling
try {
  const { error: emailError } = await supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', {...});
  if (emailError) {
    console.error('Error sending confirmation email:', emailError);
    // Continue with form submission even if email fails
  } else {
    setEmailSuccess(true);
  }
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('Error calling email function:', emailError);
  // Continue with form submission even if email fails
}

// Dynamic user feedback
{emailSuccess ? 'A confirmation email has been sent to your inbox.' : 'We\'ve received your information and will contact you soon.'}
```

### Impact
- ✅ Form always works regardless of email service status
- ✅ Clear user feedback about email status
- ✅ No lost lead data
- ✅ Improved user experience
